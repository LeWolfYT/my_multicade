a 2-in-1 arcade themed MAME frontend inspired by the iCade 60-in-1 series

## SETUP

1. Modify the backgrounds and names to reflect the games that will be emulated.
2. If you want to, you can modify the timer sprites and the sound effects. Note that looped music requires an (optional) introduction and a loop section.
3. Enter the mymulticade.py file.
4. Locate the configuration
5. Change the assets path and MAME path to reflect your setup.
6. There are a few settings here you may need to change, such as orientation, fullscreen mode, V-Sync, if the window has a border, and the width and height of the menu.
7. You can optionally change the animation speeds, but anything above 2 seconds is not advised.
8. Set the correct MAME machines
9. Optionally, configure the file names. This might be required when dealing with images or audio of different formats.
10. You have to CD into the MAME directory by launching in some scenarios.
11. Launch the program!

## FOR ARCADE OPERATORS

Sadly, I don't know of any ways to link this program to arcade hardware. However, if you do know, feel free to contribute!
You'll have to configure MAME yourself, sadly.
